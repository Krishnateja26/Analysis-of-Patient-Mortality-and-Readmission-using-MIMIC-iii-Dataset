# Abstract

We propose a multimodal predictive modeling framework aimed at enhancing the prediction of in-hospital mortality and 30-day hospital readmission by integrating both structured and unstructured clinical data from the MIMIC-III dataset. Our approach combines quantitative features such as diagnoses, procedures, and demographic information with narrative insights derived from clinical notes using ClinicalBERT embeddings. This fusion allows us to capture a more holistic view of patient health by leveraging both numeric trends and contextual language patterns in clinical documentation.

To strengthen the temporal understanding of patient trajectories, we incorporate time-stamped clinical events and analyze how the progression of medical conditions impacts outcomes. The model is benchmarked against established baselines including GRU-D and BERT-only architectures to assess its predictive performance. Additionally, we utilize interpretable machine learning techniques such as SHAP to gain insights into model behavior and feature influence.

Ultimately, our goal is to build a robust, interpretable, and scalable system that supports clinicians in identifying high-risk patients early, thereby improving care delivery, reducing readmission rates, and saving lives.

## 1 Introduction

In today’s data-driven healthcare era, technology is transforming how we understand and respond to patient needs. Hospitals around the world are moving toward smarter, more proactive care models, where predicting a patient’s health trajectory is just as important as treating the present illness. Imagine a system that could warn doctors, “This patient is at high risk of being readmitted within 30 days,” or alert nurses with insights like “This individual’s vital signs suggest a higher risk of mortality.” That’s the power of predictive modeling in healthcare.

Just like virtual assistants have revolutionized the way we handle daily tasks by understanding speech and making intelligent decisions, similar intelligence can be harnessed to support clinical decision-making. Hospital readmissions and in-hospital mortality are critical indicators of healthcare quality and resource utilization. Predicting these outcomes ahead of time could save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and allow for more personalized and preventive care.

With access to massive repositories of clinical data such as MIMIC-III and advancements in machine learning and natural language processing, especially using models like ClinicalBERT, we can now mine valuable insights from both structured data (like lab results, vitals, diagnoses) and unstructured data (like doctor’s notes). These insights enable building intelligent systems that can forecast patient outcomes, guide clinical interventions, and ultimately improve the quality of care. This project builds upon that vision—leveraging openly available clinical datasets and cutting-edge AI to build a virtual assistant for hospitals, capable of predicting readmissions and mortality risk, and supporting smarter, data-driven decisions at the bedside.

## 1.1 Problem Statement

Every year, thousands of patients are readmitted to hospitals within a short time after discharge, and many face increased risk of mortality due to undetected complications or lack of timely intervention. Despite advances in healthcare, predicting such outcomes remains a major challenge for hospitals and care providers. Doctors and nurses are often overwhelmed with large volumes of patient data, making it difficult to manually assess risks or anticipate deteriorations in real-time.

The main agenda of this project is to solve this problem. The solution is to build an intelligent assistant for hospitals that can automatically predict the likelihood of patient readmission and mortality based on both clinical records and physician notes. By using advanced machine learning models and natural language processing techniques, this system can support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.

## 1.2 Objectives

- The main objective of building a hospital readmission and mortality prediction system is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients early.

- Another objective is to reduce preventable hospital readmissions and improve patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions.

- Fundamental objectives that maximize the overall value of predictive healthcare systems are accuracy, reliability, and clinical relevance.

- Design a user-friendly and interpretable system that can be integrated into existing hospital workflows with minimal disruption.

- Improve efficiency in healthcare decision-making by automating the analysis of large-scale patient data using machine learning.

- Enhance the use of both structured clinical data and unstructured physician notes through advanced natural language processing.

- Provide actionable insights to doctors and caregivers, helping them prioritize care, manage resources better, and ultimately save lives.

## 1.3 Societal Applications

- This application has significant implications for society, especially in improving healthcare delivery and saving lives through proactive medical intervention.

- This system can help hospitals prioritize high-risk patients, reducing preventable deaths and enhancing overall patient care.

- It can support overburdened healthcare systems by streamlining decision-making and reducing manual workload for medical staff.

- This project is feasible for future upgrades, including integration with electronic health records and real-time alert systems for critical care.

- It enhances healthcare equity by using data to identify at-risk individuals who might otherwise be overlooked.

- It provides timely insights that enable better discharge planning, reducing the emotional and financial burden on patients and families.

- By automating predictions of adverse outcomes, it allows physicians to focus more on treatment and human interaction rather than data crunching.

- It ensures continuous data monitoring and analysis, helping institutions stay prepared and responsive to emergencies.

- Even with emerging challenges in healthcare, this intelligent system supports consistent, evidence-based decision-making and better resource allocation.

# 2 Literation Survey

## 2.1 Introduction

This section presents a review of existing research and systems developed for predicting hospital readmissions and patient mortality. Numerous studies and healthcare analytics solutions have been proposed that leverage data-driven models and machine learning to address these critical issues. These systems typically focus on analyzing patient data to identify those at high risk of readmission or death, enabling timely interventions and better resource allocation.

## 2.2 Analyzing the Existing System

Many existing systems apply statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to electronic health records (EHRs) for risk prediction. Popular models include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). More recent approaches use deep learning methods like LSTM and CNNs to capture temporal patterns in clinical data.

Hospitals and research institutions utilize tools such as Python, R, and platforms like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn to build predictive models. Additionally, frameworks like Apache Spark are used to handle large-scale healthcare datasets.

One widely known model is the LACE index (Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidities, and Emergency visits), which helps estimate the risk of readmission. Other institutions use proprietary scoring systems integrated into their EHR systems.

These predictive systems have shown success in identifying at-risk patients, but challenges such as data imbalance, missing values, and interpretability of black-box models remain. Ensuring model fairness and privacy compliance is also essential in clinical applications.

# 4 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is derived from MIMIC-III v1.4, a publicly available critical care database. It consists of multiple tables that provide comprehensive information about patients, their hospital admissions, diagnoses, treatments, and medications. The data spans over 40,000 hospital admissions, offering valuable insights into patient care, outcomes, and hospital performance.

## 4.1 Overview

The dataset consists of 5 main tables, each providing a specific type of information about patients and their hospital stay. These datasets allow for a deep analysis of patient demographics, admission details, medical history (diagnoses and procedures), and treatments (medications).

The data enables a comprehensive approach to understanding patient outcomes, including mortality, readmission, and the impact of various diagnoses, treatments, and patient characteristics. This structured information is essential for building predictive models in healthcare analytics, such as predicting patient outcomes or identifying risk factors for readmission.

## Dataset Files

The project utilizes 5 key datasets from the MIMIC-III v1.4 database, each contributing different aspects of a patient’s medical history and hospital stay:

## 1. ADMISSIONS.csv
Contains admission-related details including timestamps, admission/discharge types and locations, insurance, and outcomes.
Key Columns: ADMITTIME, DISCHTIME, ADMISSION_TYPE, HOSPITAL_EXPIRE_FLAG

## 2. PATIENTS.csv
Provides demographic information such as age, gender, and mortality status.
Key Columns: GENDER, DOB, DOD, EXPIRE_FLAG

## 3. DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv

# 4.2 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Handling Missing Data

**DEATHTIME:** Missing for ~53,122 records because many patients did not die during their admission. This was expected and not imputed.

**LANGUAGE:** Missing for a large portion of patients. Imputed using a constant value "Unknown".

**MARITAL_STATUS: **Missing in 10,128 records. Filled with "Unknown" or categorized accordingly.

**RELIGION:** Also had missing values and was imputed similarly using a constant "Unknown".

**EDREGTIME and EDOUTTIME:** Missing in several records and considered irrelevant for the analysis (related to emergency department registration times). These columns were dropped entirely.

## Imputation Strategy

Constant Imputation: Used for categorical fields such as LANGUAGE, MARITAL_STATUS, and RELIGION. Missing values were replaced with a placeholder like "Unknown" to retain the records without introducing bias.

## Column Dropping

Columns with excessive or non-informative missing values (e.g., EDREGTIME, EDOUTTIME) were dropped to reduce noise and maintain model relevance.

## Overall Workflow

Identified missing values.

Determined relevance based on domain knowledge.

Applied appropriate imputation or dropped columns.

Ensured cleaned data was consistent, complete, and ready for modeling.
